#My First Small Library Website with API Integration
Welcome to my first small library website with API integration! This project is an exciting step towards creating a modern and user-friendly library website that allows users to search and borrow books online.

##Features
This library website comes with the following features:

###Search Feature:
Users can search for books by title, author, or keyword. The search feature utilizes an API request to fetch relevant data from various libraries.

###Filter Tabs Feature: 
Users can filter their search results by genre, author, or publication date. This feature makes it easier for users to narrow down their search and find the books they need.

###Responsive Layout: 
The website has a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. This ensures that users can access the website from any device, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

##Technologies Used
This library website was built using the following technologies:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
API Integration (Openlibrary Api)

##How to Use
To use this library website, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Once the website loads, you can start searching for books by entering a title, author, or keyword in the search bar. You can also filter your search results by clicking on the genre, author, or publication date tabs.

##Future to be Improvements
There are several improvements that can be made to this library website in the future, including:

Adding a user authentication system to allow users to create accounts and save their favorite books
Improving the search algorithm to provide more accurate and relevant results
Adding more filter options to help users narrow down their search even further
Adding the interface to read the books on the website instead of being redirected to openlibrary (the api used)
Adding the functionality to download books
